      When we listen to music, our brains release dopamine, a neurotransmitter
      that
      <br />
      allows us to feel happy. A study conducted by Valorie Salimpoor, a
      neuroscientist
      <br />
      at McGill University, shows us how this worked. The participants of the
      study
      <br />
      were connected to an fMRI machine that recorded their brain activity. They
      <br />
      listened to their favorite songs and during the peak emotional parts of
      the
      <br />
      song, the researchers saw that dopamine was released.
